# Vehicle Routing Problem Solver

This repository provides a solution for the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). The VRP involves finding the optimal routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to a set of customers, starting and ending at a central depot.

## Problem Description

In the VRP, we have:
- A single depot where all vehicles start and end their routes.
- A set of customers, each with a specific demand for goods.
- The goal is to find the optimal set of routes for vehicles to minimize the total distance traveled while satisfying customer demands.

## Features

- Calculation of optimal routes for each vehicle.
- Consideration of vehicle capacity constraints.
- Visualization of the routes on a map.
- [Any other relevant features]


## Input Data:

   Provide input data in a suitable format. This may include:
   - Coordinates of the depot and customers.
   - Customer demands.
   - Vehicle capacities.


## Results
The output will include the optimal routes for each vehicle, the total distance traveled, and any other relevant statistics.
